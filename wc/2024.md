  workshops-a:
  - title: "Follow Me – The Call of Christ into a Personal Relationship with Him"  
    desc: "In this workshop, we will consider the call of Christ to enter into a personal relationship with Him and define \
           what it means to be one of His disciples. It will also equip you to be an ardent disciple who lives with daily \
           purpose, meaning, and eternal significance."  
  - title: "The Regulative Principle of Worship"
    desc: "What comes to mind when you hear the phrase, \"the regulative principle of worship\"? A theological straitjacket on our Christian liberty? \
           A kill-joy attitude toward Christian worship? A codeword for Reformed arrogance towards other worship practices? In this workshop, we will \
           examine what the regulative principle is, why we hold to it, and the joy and confidence it can bring us as we worship our Redeemer. We will \
           see how it is a doctrine full of comfort for Christians who desire to worship the Lord in \"spirit and truth\" (John 4:24)."
  workshops-b:
  - title: "Joy and Peace in Christ"
    desc: "Sinful anxiety is the enemy of peace and joy in Christ. In this workshop, we will explore Philippians 4:4-11 and consider what it means to \
           have peace and joy with Christ. Is all anxiety sinful? How can I know if I have peace with God when I don't feel like I do? How can I know \
           I am saved? We will explore these questions and more in this workshop."  
  - title: "The Beauty and Majesty of the Whole"
    desc: "This workshop will focus on recognizing biblical themes and the impact of their use and development throughout Scripture, leading us to stand in awe of its Author as we know and love Him more"
