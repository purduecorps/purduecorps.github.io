  workshops-a:
  - title: "How Do I Meditate On God's Word?"  
    desc: >
      Thomas Watson wrote, “The reason we come away so cold from reading the word is, because we do not warm ourselves at the fire of meditation.” 
      The Puritans described meditation as having a conversation with yourself about the Word of God in the presence of God. 
      But how do we have this conversation? 
      This session will help you get more out of your private worship as you draw closer to God.
  - title: "Overcoming Intellectual Paralysis in Evangelism and Apologetics"
    desc: >
      Do you feel fearful and unprepared to talk about Jesus? 
      Does the thought of sharing Jesus with your friends and family make you nervous? 
      Have you ever thought, "There is so much I don't know, how can I intelligently talk about Christianity?" 
      You are not alone. 
      In this workshop, we will talk about tools and strategies to help give you, by the power of the Holy Spirit, 
      confidence in sharing and defending the faith.

  - title: "Precenting 101: How to Lead God’s People in Singing His Praises"
    desc: >
      God has given us the Psalms so that we can sing them to His glory. 
      It is an important element of our worship, especially when the congregation gathers on the Lord’s Day. 
      But the church needs a leader to guide and direct them in their singing. 
      That is the job of the precentor. 
      In this workshop we will learn the basics of precenting so that you can contribute to God’s worship in this pivotal way.
  - title: "Learning to Lead: Missions, Leadership, and Small Group Communication"
    desc: >
      Based on our leadership training, this session by RP Missions will walk through the basics of small group communication 
      and what leadership can look like on short-term mission fields.
