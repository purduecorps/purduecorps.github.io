  workshops-a:
  - title: "Slave of All: Learning the Heart of Christ Toward Others"  
    desc: "Jesus’ astounding demand that we be “slaves of all” is followed up with an astonishing claim: “For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Mark 10:44-45). In this workshop, we will investigate how knowing the heart of Christ for us– the heart that led Him to suffer and die–leads us to the radical formation of a servant heart of love towards others."  
  - title: "Strong and Weak in Christ"  
    desc: "\"For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God\" (2 Cor. 13:4). To be a Christian is to know you are weak and also to know you are to be strong in God. How does our weakness and strength relate? How do we live in Christ's suffering and power at the same time? We will consider this theme in our workshop and find its relation to our flourishing in Christ. Material for this workshop will be pulled from Andy Crouch's highly-regarded book, Strong and Weak. "  
  workshops-b:
  - title: "Gospel Hope for the Sluggard"  
    desc: "Laziness is a destructive and a deadly sin. Solomon tells us, “Whoever is slack in his work is a brother to him who destroys” and “The desire of the sluggard kills him” (Prov. 18:9; 21:25). This workshop will first examine the nature and dangers of this sin. Second, it will explore how the cure for laziness is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ, not our own efforts. Third, it will outline practical steps we can take, in light of the gospel, to combat this sin."
