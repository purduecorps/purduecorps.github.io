> "Having thus a fond affection for you, we were well please to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us." ~ I Thessalonians 2:8

CORPS aims to help students know, love, and serve Jesus Christ. We recognize the importance of making the college years a time of spiritual growth even as we devote ourselves to our academic studies. As a group of students integrated with the [Reformed Presbyterian Church of Lafayette](https://reformedlafayette.com), we enjoy growth and fellowship in the context of a local congregation of God’s people. Additionally, we have a variety of opportunities designed specifically for college students. These include:
{:.text-justify}

- Conferences and retreats
- Bible studies
- Sports events and game nights
- Evangelism and discipleship training
- Home-cooked meals in the homes of church members
- Times of prayer and singing
- Spring break trips
